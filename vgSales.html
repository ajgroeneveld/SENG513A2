<h1>How Genre Affects Video Game Sales</h1>

<p>
Have you ever wondered what effect a video game's genre might have on its global sales? That is the answer I attempted to answer using a linear regression model in R
</p>
<p>
    I used data on global video game sales from before December 2nd 2016 <br><br>

    <br>
    The R code to do this is actually quite simple as we can see below<br><br>

    <br>
    From this we get a model that estimates a videogame's sales purely based on the genre
    <br>

    Obviously this R-Squared statistic is awful so this model is basically useless in terms of prediction, but it is interesting to see the general effect that a genre has on sales. In this case <b>Adventure</b>, <b>Simulation</b>, and <b>Strategy</b> games will sell fewer copies based on the genre
